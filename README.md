http2 explained
===============

This is a detailed document (and associated presentation) describing http2,
the background, concepts, protocol and something about existing
implementations and what the future might hold.

See http://daniel.haxx.se/http2/ for the canonical home for this project where
there's also a more friendly PDF format of this document available. I hope to
host and announce updates to this document there.

I encourage and welcome help and contributions from anyone who may have
